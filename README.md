## About

### Vertex

Vertex aims to be an ecosystem of self-hosted services. Eventually, the idea is to be able to install new services on your HomeLab in one click.

Vertex is designed to be installed on low-powered computers like Raspberry Pi, so avoiding systems like Docker and prioritizing compiled languages like Go, Rust or C++.

### Vertex Installer

This repository contains Vertex Core, which allows to install services easily.
